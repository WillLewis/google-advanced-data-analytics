# Google Advanced Data Analytics Projects

First off I'd like thank Google for putting together such a rigorous and engaging certificate program. The Google Advanced Data Analytics course offered an exceptional level of technical depth. It gave me an opportunity to tune my advanced machine learning skills, refine hyperparameter tuning strategies, and extract insights from complex datasets. The programâ€™s focus on real-world data challenges, like classifying TikTok videos as claims or opinions, allowed me to work on some interesting problems and apply new EDA, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques. 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks from the capstones for the four most interesting classes, covering a wide range of data analysis topics:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into TikTok video data using Python and pandas.
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing and statistical summaries of TikTok datasets.
- **Regression**: Predicting TikTok video characteristics using linear regression.
- **Machine Learning**: Modeling video engagement features with classification models.

Before getting into the concepts covered and tools used here's a list of easter eggs I found in each capstone project.

## Easter Eggs Found

ðŸ¥š I discovered some fun Easter eggs in each lab, which I discuss below:
- **Lab 3**: Interesting correlation between variables that led to unexpected insights.
- **Lab 4**: A hidden feature in the p-value analysis that made the results more interpretable.
- **Lab 5**: An intriguing result from the multicollinearity check that surprised me.
- **Lab 6**: A twist in the hyperparameter tuning process that led to a better model.
