    "The question proposed by the team was to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of views for TikTok videos posted by verified accounts versus unverified accounts. The approach proposed was a two-sample hypothesis test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on EDA conducted previously (prior class) we know that there are two potential issues with the assumptions required for using a two-sample hypothesis test: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal distribution**: video views were not normally distributed but right skewed, following the normal pattern for social engagement, where relatively small proportions of posts tend to account for relatively large portion of views; and\n",
    "- **Random sampling**: verified accounts in the prior sample had a higher proportion of opinion videos and unverified accounts had a higher proportion of claim videos. The data from that sample also indicated that claim videos had much higher median views than opinion videos. Therefore, simply testing verified versus unverfied accounts may lead to bias samples which may impact the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "To account for these issues - in addition to doing the assignment - I'll take five additional steps as part of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Claim status mean testing**: test whether claim videos still have higher mean video views than opinion videos in this sample as they did in the prior sample\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Claim difference relevance test** While there might be a difference in claim video proportions amongst verified and unverified acccounts, we don't know whether the extent of the difference is statistically relevant. So I'll test whether claim status and verified status of videos are independent -- whether the proportion of claim videos is statistically the same for both verified and unverified accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Cluster sample**: If the difference in claim proportion is statistically significant, I will break-down verified and unverified accounts by claim status as part of testing for the difference in video views\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Two-sample z-test for proportions**: Since z-tests for proportions don't require normally distributed data, I will test for a statistically significant difference in the proportions of video views with above-median views within each cluster of claim and opinion verified and unverified accounts. In order to do this I will set the median video view count as the threshold for significance\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Mann-Whitney U test for distribution difference**: Since Mann Whitney U tests are more robust against skewed data I will test for a difference in the view count distribution between each cluster of claim and opinion verified and unverified accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- For the purposes of this analysis, I treat the isolation of verified status by claim status as a required EDA and probability sampling step to answer the question ahead of setting the null and alternative hypothesis as opposed to a change in the null and alternative hypothesis, although a strong case can be made for the later. \n",
    "- I understand the question was whether there is a difference in the number of views across verification status, and by testing for differences in proportions or distributions I am changing the question. From a business perspective, the information, nonetheless could be useful for the larger objective of building a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion.\n",
    "- I acknowledge that while the z-test for proportions of continuous skewed data using the standard error as a proxy of population standard deviation is not ideal. \n",
    "- I understand changing a hypothesis is not scientific. I consider the steps taken here (along with my failed attempts to approximate a normal distribution with log, square root and other transformations) as attempts to re-phrase the original question - before testing - in order to provide more meaningful insight. \n"

    "The analysis requested was a two-sample t-test of means, which by definition assumes a normal distribution of data. I determined from EDA, the video view count was extremely skewed. I also determined a relationship between verified status and claim status which could lead to bias. Nonetheless, I ran a two-sample -t-test of means and found a statistically significant difference between video view count of verified and unverified creators. However, I knew we couldn't rely on the results because of the previously mentioned skewed distribution and non-random sample.  \n",

In fact, I’d suggest that based on the inability to reject the null hypotheses of the z-test of proportions and Mann Whitney U test of distributions, that when isolating for claim vs opinion data, we can not say there's enough evidence to support a difference in view count purely based on differences in verification status. \n",
